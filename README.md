# Magic-Math-Game
A simple Python program that does magic math to correctly "guess" a number that a user is thinking of.
## Installation and Dependencies 
Python 3 language
## Purpose and Description
This simple program employs a math trick to correctly "guess" (deduce) a number that a user is thinking of.
This program works by collaborating with a human user. The program and the user collaborate by individually performing simple mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
The user first thinks of a number. 
Then the program prompts the user to perform several mathematical operations. 
Next the program generates a random number, and the user must employ that random number in a further mathematical operation. 
After the program performs its own mathematical calculation, it is able to correctly deduce the result that the user came up with.
Note: Even though the user collaborates with the program by inputing responses, the user never tells the program which number he or she starts with. In fact, the user does not input any specific number during the process.
## History
This program utilizes a simple math trick I learned a long time ago while having a pint at my local pub. A stranger sitting next to me at the bar proposed a bet. He bet that he could guess what number I was thinking of. After he performed the trick (and won a beer), he showed me how to carry out the magic trick. I have now employed that magic trick in this Python program.
